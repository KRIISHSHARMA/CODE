3. **RISC-V**  - It is an ISA based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. It is Open Source unlike the parent RISC.
4. **Kernel** - programm to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory  
- Kernel Programming Languages
  - C
  - Rust
  - C++
5. **DNS** - turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
6. **ISA** - Instruction Set Architecture - hardware interaction - input-outputs, registers, data types
7. **IP Addresss**- Internet Protcol (IPv4,IPv6)
 - Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet service provider to the device
 - Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168]
 - Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0]
9. **Port No.** - a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.[for http - 80
 - SSH(Secure Shell) - 22
 - SMTP - 25  
 - Telnet - 23
 - https - 443
 - DNS - 53
10. **SSL**- Secure Socket Layer - IP Address + Port Number
11. **Seven Layers Of OSI**(Open Systems Interconnection)
 - L7 - Application
 - L6 - Presentation
 - L5 - Cryptography
 - L4 - Port Number(16 Bits)
 - L3 - IP Address (32 Bits) : Router
 - L2 - Hardware Address - NIC, MAC Address(48 Bits) : Ethernet :*SWITCH*
 - L1 - Digital (1 and 0)

12. **Switch** - connects devices in a network to each other, enabling them to talk by exchanging data packets. [ layer 2 of OSI]
13. **Virtual Machine** - created by using Hypervisor
14. **FPGA** - Field Programmable Gate Arrays  - Configurede after manufacturing
15. **Socket** - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
16. **TCP** - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
17. **MAC Address** - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.(48 bits)
18. **Protocol**- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
19. **Firmware** - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
20. **TLS** - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet
21. **Cache** - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)
22. **STACK** - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. **LIFO** (Last In First Out)

23. Von Neuman Architecture 
Hagward Architecture 

24. **Debian** - Linux Software/OS Family
25. **VMware Workstation** - IT is a line of Desktop Hypervisor products which lets users run virtual machines, multiple OS
26. **VPN** - It establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
27. **Cryptography** - It is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. It is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. 
28. **Hypervisor** - It is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
    - TYPE 1 : hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware
    - TYPE 2 : hypervisor is typically installed on top of an existing OS.
30. **BareMetal**- Fresh Servers
31. **IAM** - Identity and access management
32. **nginx** - proxy server
33. **apache** - client server - uses httpd(d stands for dameon:continuously runs in background) that creates a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests.
34. **OOPS** - "object oriented programming systum/structue", It is a programming model based on the concept of “objects,” which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.
 -The 4 pillers of **opps** :
  -**Encapsulation** :refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.
  -**Abstraction**  :is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.
  -**Inheritence** :one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.
  -**Polymorphism** :is the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs different things as per the object's class, which calls it.
35. **Certificate Authority** - (CA) is a trusted entity that issues Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates
36. **Certificate X.509** - The certificate is typically used to manage identity and security in computer networking and over the internet. For the internet, it is used in numerous protocols to ensure a malicious website doesn't fool a web browser. The X. 509 certificate is also used to secure email, device communications and digital signatures. 
  - (CA) ex:- GoDaddy , Let's Encrypt(open) etc.
  - Signing Certificate algorithm is Cryptography : RSA, Elliptic Curve
37. **Load Blanacer** - is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.
     -Algorithm is **ROUND ROBIN**
38. **Round Robin** - Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. It is basically the preemptive version of First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm. Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique.
39. **NAT** - ( network address translation ) It's a way to map multiple private addresses inside a local network to a public IP address before transferring the information onto the internet.<translates privete ip to publice ip and vica verse>
40. **ASIC** - ( App specific integrated ckt. ) is an integrated circuit chip customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use, such as a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency video codec. ex- ***BITCOIN MINER***
